A pure React.js app that built through React.js Fundamentals course on [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). This repo contains a better version of each components separation. Written from scratch, so it has some differences with the [original version](https://github.com/ReactTraining/React-Fundamentals). See the deployed one at <https://super-github-battle.firebaseapp.com>.
